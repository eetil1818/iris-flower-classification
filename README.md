## ‚öôÔ∏è Modelling
- Cross-validated 5 models:
      | Model                   | CV Score | Training Time (s) |
      |--------------------------|----------|------------------|
      | Logistic Regression      | 0.932    | 1.09             |
      | Decision Tree Classifier | 0.961    | 0.67             |
      | Random Forest Classifier | 0.961    | 0.64             |
      | SGD Classifier           | 0.932    | 0.02             |
      | Support Vector Classifier| 0.922    | 0.01             |
- Selected Logistic Regression for hyperparameter tuning (grid search) for its balanced performance and better generalization compared to other models.
